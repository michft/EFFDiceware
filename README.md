# EFFDiceware

This repository contains EFF's new Diceware-style wordlist for random
passphrases in printable format. 

### Diceware

Diceware is a way of generating passphrases that are highly readable
and memorizable, unlike common "ASCII gibberish" passwords, but at the
same time are truly random and almost impossible to brute force. The idea
is to use 5 six-sided dice to generate 6 or more heximal numbers in 
range 11111 - 66666 (total of 7,776 numbers) and use those as indices into
a list of words, which are then combined in any convenient way to form a
passphrase. More information can be found at the 
[original Diceware page](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html).
EFF's wordlist is an improved list of words that solves some of the problems
of the original one, such as use of symbols, bigrams and rare words. More
information about EFF's wordlist can be found in the 
[dedicated article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases).
The wordlist was published in "raw" txt format which is good for lookups, but
there are geeks like me who like it fully "offline" or in dead-tree edition, so
here is a PDF file, that can be printed and folded into a handy booklet.
